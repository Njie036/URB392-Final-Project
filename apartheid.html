                <h1>Apartheid - Thione Seck</h1>
                <p class="sidekick-text">The song “Apartheid” by Thione Seck provides a sad portrayal of the enduring struggles faced by the people of South Africa under apartheid rule. Through evocative lyrics, Seck delves into the intergenerational nature of apartheid's oppression, highlighting how its effects have spanned multiple generations. In the song, he opens with “barki demb seni mame, demb seni baye, taye nyorm seni dorm” which translates to “day before yesterday their grandparents, yesterday their fathers, and today them and their children”. This illustrates how apartheid has been ingrained in the fabric of South African society, affecting grandparents, parents, and now children.
                    In addition, Seck's depiction of being born and raised in a country where one has no voice and is constantly stripped of dignity in front of their children captures the profound psychological and emotional toll of apartheid. The line "judo si rew, magae sii rew, amulor fa baat, amorfa yorn, suba suneeh nyu simila defla yaramuneen, dinga jegu" which translates to “being born and raised in a country where you have no voice, and everyday, you are stripped naked infront of your kids, you will strive to get out of it”. This speaks to the resilience and determination of individuals to break free from the shackles of oppression, despite the immense challenges they face.
                    Seck's portrayal of feeling powerless and fearful in the face of apartheid's brutality resonates with the theme of struggle and resistance against oppression discussed in class when we talked about the way women works talks about raising kids that would grow up to hate them. The line "khifal ma dima ligaye lor, awma doleh khek, ba sumala guisae damaey tiit, sorma saaga maneh waw, ohh apartheid" which means “making me hungry, I have no power to fight, I get scared whenever I see you, when you insult me I say yes, ohh apartheid”. This underscores the oppressive nature of apartheid, where individuals are silenced and forced into submission through hunger, fear, and intimidation.
