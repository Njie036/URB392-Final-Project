                <h1>Sey dou choix - Coumba Gawlo and Souleymane Faye</h1>
                <p class="sidekick-text">The song delves into the societal pressure surrounding marriage, particularly emphasizing the expectations placed on women to marry at a certain age. The phrase "Sey dou choix" meaning "marriage is not choice" underscores the cultural norms that dictate marriage as an expectation rather than a personal decision. In Senegal and Gambia, there's often discussion about the delayed marriage of urban women. Coumba opens the song with the line "bess bu nekk yangi degue kunaan la loye kharr ba seyagor, wayeh saey du choix, saey chance la" which translates to "you hear everyday people asking what are you waiting for to get married but marriage is not a choice but a chance." This highlights the societal pressure and the notion that marriage is perceived more as an opportunity than a decision. This connects to the class theme of examining societal norms and their impact on individuals within African urban contexts, shedding light on the complexities of gender roles and expectations.
