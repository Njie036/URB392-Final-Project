                <h1>No more - Youssou Ndour</h1>
                <p class="sidekick-text">This song of Youssou Ndour from his Eyes Open album that came out in 1992 reflects themes of disappointment, frustration, and the desire for change. The lyrics convey a sense of unfulfilled promises and missed opportunities. Ndour's repetition of phrases like “You said you do it, Promise to make, So far nothing” underscores a sense of betrayal and skepticism towards authority or those in power. This sentiment of unmet expectations and the need for meaningful action speaks to larger issues of governance, development, and social justice in Senegal and those living in Dakar. The repeated refrain of "No more, No more" suggests a call for an end to the current state of affairs and a demand for change. This sentiment resonates with our previous discussions on resistance, activism, and the pursuit of social transformation, particularly in reference to movements like the "bul faleh" movement in Dakar.
