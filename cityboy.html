                <h1>City Boy - Burna Boy</h1>
                <p class="sidekick-text">
                    The song "City Boys" by Burna Boy delves into themes of self-perception, societal pressure, and urban identity. At the begging of the song, he says “Ayo, I'm not even gonna lie
                    I used to call myself a ugly yute, but I'm not even a ugly yute, I'm a sexy yute, you understand?
                    Gyal all over the globe wanna 'uck me, you understand?”. In this lines, he reflects on his past insecurities, where he used to consider himself unattractive but now embraces his identity as a confident and desirable individual. This highlights the complexities of self-image and the influence of societal norms on personal identity, particularly in urban environments where appearances often hold significant value.
                    Burna Boy's portrayal of the "City Boy" lifestyle, characterized by materialism, hedonism, and urban swagger, offers insights into the cultural dynamics of city life in contemporary African society. The song captures challenges of urban living, where individuals navigate between societal expectations and personal desires.
                    In the context of our class discussions, “City Boys” can be analyzed through the lens of urbanization and cultural identity in African cities. It speaks to the ways in which urban environments shape individual experiences and perceptions, as well as the complex interplay between tradition and modernity in urban settings. Burna Boy's lyrics reflect the vibrancy and diversity of urban life while also touching on deeper themes of self-acceptance and cultural belonging, which are central to understanding the complexities of African urban societies.
