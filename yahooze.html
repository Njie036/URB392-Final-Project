                    Yahooze is the hit single released in 2007 by Olu Maintain. The song glamorizes materialism and ostentatious living from illegal means. The term ‘Yahooze’ is a reference to Yahoo! Messenger, the social app by Yahoo. This app was regularly used by individuals engaged in advance fee scams to con their targets. The use of Yahoo! Messenger as a tool for facilitating the advance-fee scams highlights how urban populations leverage technology and transnational connections in both positive and negative ways, shaping the dynamics of urban environments and their connections to global flows. 
The song sheds light on the prevalence of informal and sometimes illegal economic activities, like advance-fee scams, that arose in urban centers due to lack of formal employment opportunities, especially for youth. This crime became prevalent in urban centers around Africa in the late 2000s and onwards due to the explosive population growth and lack of jobs and employment for the youth coming out of school. During this time, internet use and access started to become prominent in urban areas, usually at computer cafes that individuals can pay to access the internet. This challenges traditional notions of urban economies and highlights the need to understand the complexities of how people navigate and create economic landscapes outside of the formal sector. 
In the song, Olu Maintain states, “If I hammer, 1st thing na hummer, 1 million dollars,” meaning if he is successful with his scam, he’s going to earn a million dollars, and the first thing he will buy is a GMC Hummer SUV, which was popular as a status symbol of wealth due to its popularity in rap and use by wealthy artists. He further describes how they work every day, stating, “Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Boys dey hustle.” And that they will spend it on everyone, saying, “Champagne, Hennessy, Moet; For everybody.” While the song glamorizes an illegal activity, it can also be seen as a cultural expression and commentary on the lived realities, aspirations, and frustrations of urban youth in that particular socio-economic context.
