                <h1>Colonial Mentality - Fela Kuti</h1>
                <p class="sidekick-text">
                    In this song, Fela confronts the lingering psychological impacts of colonialism on Africans' sense of self-worth and seeks to decolonize their minds. He challenges the indoctrination of Africans to adopt Eurocentric and Western views, defining "colo-mentality" as akin to being a "slave man" who has been physically liberated but not mentally emancipatedâ€”a searing critique of those still ensnared in a colonial mindset even after independence. Fela further explores how this mentality leads individuals to perceive themselves as "better than their brothers," fostering divisions and a false sense of superiority over fellow Africans who maintain their cultural identities. By esteeming Eurocentric values above their own, they perpetuate a cycle of self-denigration and cultural inferiority. 
He continues by addressing the tendency to regard anything African as inferior, as expressed in the line, "The things black aren't good; They prefer foreign things." This underscores the detrimental internalization of a belief that devalues African culture while elevating foreign or Western ideals. Fela's lyrics poignantly illustrate how some Africans have adopted the notion that foreign goods and values supersede their indigenous counterparts, resulting in a preference for foreign products and attitudes. This preference, in turn, perpetuates the degradation of African culture and perpetuates the enduring legacy of colonialism.
