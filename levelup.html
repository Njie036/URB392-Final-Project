                <h1>Level Up - Burna Boy and Youssou Ndour</h1>
                <p class="sidekick-text">The song Level Up from Burna Boy’s “Twice as Tall” told features Youssou Ndour. It is a surprise to see knowing that wolof is only spoken by people in Gambians and Senegalese. Having Youssou Ndour in the song shows how African artist come together no matter the difference in languages. The song encapsulates themes of resilience and determination, reflecting Burna Boy's journey of overcoming challenges to achieve success. He acknowledges past struggles and setbacks, such as feeling inadequate and unable to "level up," yet he refuses to give up. Burna Boy's declaration to “never stop” and to “come back standing twice as tall” embodies a spirit of resilience and perseverance when in difficulty. Youssou Ndour adds “Niafer Ko,
                    Djek Djekal ko. You can do it, whoa, whoa. Never, never, never, never, never, never, never stop
                    Gueumeul sa bop way” which means struggle for it and never give up. This song motivates youth and residents of African cities to be resilient by highlighting the strength and determination of individuals and communities in overcoming socio-economic challenges.
