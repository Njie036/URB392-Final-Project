                <h1>Welcome Home - Osibisa</h1>
                <p class="sidekick-text">Welcome home is the title of the seventh album of the Afro Rock band Osibisa. The album cover depicts band members in indigenous African outfits and with traditional instruments, visually tying their music to African cultural roots. The title track “Welcome Home” has lyrics that speak to people of African descent who have been away too long, alluding to the histories of slavery, colonialism and oppression that displaced Africans. Lines like "You've been gone it's an empty home" and “You’ve been kept on for much too long” are calling diasporans back to Africa as their true home after enduring long periods of forced removal and captivity. The lyrics suggest a joyful, liberated return when one is “ready to know” their roots with the affirmation “I am free.”
