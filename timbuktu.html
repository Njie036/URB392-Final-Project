                <h1>Timbuktu Fasso - Fatoumata Diawara</h1>
                <p class="sidekick-text">Fatoumata dedicates this song to Timbuktu, Mali that was overrun by Islamist insurgents and she describes how people cannot play music anymore as music is banned, children don't go to school. Her hope is for all that to finish one day and that freedom must come. The song is a soundtrack to the 2014 film Timbuktu directed by Abderrahmane Sissako. In the song Fatoumata describes her home Timbuktu, she states “Ko o ye ne faso ye, n balimalu Maliba ye ne faso ye, aw bɛ kasi la mun na, denmisɛnnu bɛ ka si la mun na, aw bɛ kasi la mun na” meaning that is my country Mali and that is my brothers, why are the children crying. She further continues “ko siniɲɛsigi jɔrɔ de bɛ an na” meaning there is worry about the future. This song connects to the theme of the class when it comes to connecting the past, present and future. By weaving together themes of loss, hope, and the yearning for a better tomorrow, “Timbuktu Fasso” shows the timeless struggle of communities like Timbuktu to overcome oppression and reclaim their cultural heritage. In doing so, it embodies the course’s exploration of how the past shapes the present and influences future trajectories within African cities, highlighting the resilience of communities in the face of adversity.
