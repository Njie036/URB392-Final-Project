                <h1>Together As One - Lucky Dube</h1>
                <p class="sidekick-text">Together as one is the title track from Lucky Dubeâ€™s eight studio album. In this song Dube conveys a message of unity for people to come together as one to end apartheid. With lyrics like "We've got to come together as one; Hey you rasta man; Hey European, Indian man; We've got to come together as one; Not forgetting the Japanese" he shares a dream of overcoming hatred and bringing people together across racial, ethnic and national lines. By emphasizing the need for people to come together regardless of their differences, Dube highlights the universality of the struggle against oppression and discrimination. Through his music, Dube becomes a voice for the marginalized and oppressed, using his platform to inspire collective action and solidarity in the fight for justice and freedom.
